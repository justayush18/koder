<p>        Hello, my name is KODER.in I am here for you to show you a HTML program and their some detaills about <br>
       HTML,basically I will do your work easier and smoother,value your presious time and I will  give you the  best result <br>
       form your input.
</p>

<p>        Normally,I am serving you a ready maid code of HTML and it's output and this code are available in our E-Content <br>
         page of our University application.Folloing are the all HTML codes and output.

 <li><div> HTML's history. </div></li>
   <p> HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. <br>It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.</p>

<li><div> How HTML works? </div></li>

<p> Quite simply, HTML works by telling the internet browser how to display the page.<br>
First, the author uses a basic text editor on the computer (such as TextEdit for Mac) to create their HTML document.<br> The author then fills their HTML document with a series of HTML elements,<br>in next we will using HTML tags and how does they are work and also we used almost HTML tags in our codes.

<li><div>What are the HTML tags? </div></li>

<p>Essentially, HTML tags are markers which tell the browser how the enclosed text should be displayed. Here’s a simple example is like

This text should be bold.<br>

 They are marking the enclosed text as “bold”—hence, the “markup” element of HTML. We’ll explain how to actually write tags in the next section.<br>

Once the document is complete, the author saves it as a html file and opens it in their internet browser.<br> The browser then reads the file and follows the instructions to render the page in a certain way—as provided by the HTML tags.<br>

So, when you use the “bold” tags, you’re essentially telling the browser to display this sentence in bold: 
This text should be bold.<br>

When the browser reads this, it knows to display the sentence as described: This text should be bold.<br>

Of course, the HTML tags themselves are not displayed in the browser (unless you make a mistake writing them!).<br>
